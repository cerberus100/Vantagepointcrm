## 🚨 **Key Issues Identified**

### **Issue #1: Production Frontend (Amplify) Offline**
**Problem**: The Amplify deployment at `main.dfh82x9nr61u2.amplifyapp.com` is not responding

**Root Cause**: 
- Amplify app may have been stopped/deleted
- Or deployment failed
- Or domain expired

**Solution Options**:
1. **Redeploy to Amplify** (Recommended)
2. **Use local development** (Current working solution)
3. **Deploy to alternative hosting** (Vercel, Netlify)

### **Issue #2: SSL Certificate Warnings**
**Problem**: Backend uses self-signed SSL certificate

**Impact**: Browsers show security warnings

**Solution**: 
- Users must manually accept certificate
- For production: Use Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager

### **Issue #3: Frontend Code Split**
**Problem**: Frontend code exists in TWO locations:
- `/app/` directory (root level) - **Currently working**
- `/frontend-nextjs/` directory (mostly empty)

**Impact**: Confusion about which codebase to use

**Solution**: Root `/app/` directory is the active codebase
