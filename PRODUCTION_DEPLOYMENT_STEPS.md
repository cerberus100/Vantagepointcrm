# üöÄ VantagePoint CRM - Production Deployment Steps

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub - Awaiting Amplify deployment

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED STEPS**

### **1. Fixed Amplify Configuration** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Amplify was looking for code in `frontend-nextjs/` directory (mostly empty)
- **Solution**: Updated `amplify.yml` to use root directory where actual code lives
- **File**: `amplify.yml` - Removed `appRoot: frontend-nextjs` line

### **2. Fixed Authentication Flow** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Frontend was calling wrong endpoint `/auth/me` instead of `/auth/profile`
- **Solution**: Updated all API calls to use correct endpoint
- **Files**: `app/page.tsx`, `app/login/page.tsx`

### **3. Fixed Token Storage** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Inconsistent token storage (`token` vs `authToken`)
- **Solution**: Standardized on `authToken` throughout codebase
- **Files**: `app/page.tsx`

### **4. Added Error Handling** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: No graceful error handling for API failures
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Files**: `app/page.tsx`

### **5. Updated Demo Credentials** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Login page showed wrong password
- **Solution**: Updated to show correct password `VantagePoint2024!`
- **Files**: `app/login/page.tsx`

### **6. Committed and Pushed to GitHub** ‚úÖ
- **Branch**: `hotfix/rollback-2025-10-06`
- **Commits**: 
  - `b71a764` - Fix Amplify config and authentication flow
  - `08d17e3` - Add package-lock.json and next-env.d.ts
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub successfully

## üîÑ **NEXT STEPS - AWS Amplify**

### **Amplify Should Auto-Deploy:**

AWS Amplify is configured to automatically deploy when code is pushed to GitHub. Here's what should happen:

**1. Amplify Detects Push** (within 1-2 minutes)
   - Amplify monitors your GitHub repository
   - Detects the new commits on `hotfix/rollback-2025-10-06` branch

**2. Build Process Starts** (5-10 minutes)
   - Runs `npm install --force`
   - Builds Next.js app with `npm run build`
   - Creates static export in `out/` directory
   - Sets environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://3.83.217.40/api/v1`

**3. Deployment** (2-3 minutes)
   - Deploys built files to CloudFront CDN
   - Updates the Amplify URL

**4. Production Ready** (Total: ~10-15 minutes)
   - Site accessible at `https://main.dfh82x9nr61u2.amplifyapp.com`

---

## üîç **HOW TO MONITOR DEPLOYMENT**

### **Option 1: AWS Console**
1. Go to AWS Amplify Console
2. Select your app
3. View "Build history" tab
4. Watch the build progress in real-time

### **Option 2: Check Deployment Status**
```bash
# Wait a few minutes, then test:
curl -s https://main.dfh82x9nr61u2.amplifyapp.com | grep "VantagePoint CRM"
```

If you see "VantagePoint CRM" in the output, deployment succeeded!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IF AMPLIFY DOESN'T AUTO-DEPLOY**

### **Possible Issues:**

**1. Branch Not Connected to Amplify**
- Amplify might be watching `main` branch only
- Solution: Merge hotfix into main or configure Amplify to watch hotfix branch

**2. Amplify App Deleted/Stopped**
- The Amplify app might have been deleted
- Solution: Create new Amplify app and connect to GitHub

**3. Build Configuration Issues**
- Amplify might have cached old configuration
- Solution: Trigger manual redeploy in Amplify console

---

## üöÄ **ALTERNATIVE: MERGE TO MAIN BRANCH**

If Amplify is only watching the `main` branch, you need to merge:

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge hotfix
git merge hotfix/rollback-2025-10-06

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

**Note**: There may be merge conflicts that need to be resolved.
