# Critical Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Resolved
The Amplify build was failing because essential configuration files were missing:
- ❌ `package.json` - **FIXED**
- ❌ `package-lock.json` - **FIXED**
- ❌ `tailwind.config.js` - **FIXED**
- ❌ `postcss.config.js` - **FIXED**
- ❌ `tsconfig.json` - **FIXED**

## Actions Taken
1. Created proper `package.json` with all necessary dependencies
2. Ran `npm install` to generate `package-lock.json`
3. Added Tailwind CSS configuration
4. Added PostCSS configuration
5. Added TypeScript configuration

## Build Status
- **Commit**: `7eba8a3` - "Critical fix: Add missing package.json and configuration files"
- **Expected Build Time**: 3-5 minutes from push
- **URL**: https://main.dfh82x9nr61u2.amplifyapp.com

## What to Expect
The Amplify build should now:
1. ✅ Install dependencies properly
2. ✅ Build the Next.js application
3. ✅ Generate static export files
4. ✅ Deploy successfully
